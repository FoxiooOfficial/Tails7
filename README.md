## 🦊 About

**Tails7 is a Mode7-style engine for Clickteam Fusion.** It does not use additional extensions and works by reversing calculations from the shader.

- The engine is designed to handle multiple modes as it needs to map the object, scale, display on the screen and more.
- Very easy to use and has many tutorials and <a href="https://foxioo.itch.io/tails7examples">**✨special examples✨**</a>.

ℹ️ This is my first so advanced project, for any inadequacies and errors please report it and I will try to fix it.

💝 I would like to sincerely thank them because the project would not work out:
- Sketchy / MuddyMole
- Linky
- Glace Sue
- Clickteam
